# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hi, I'm Kilian, aka @only-a-user. With this blog I want to explore some topics interesting to me.
  Posts won't be regularly scheduled, I'll post whenever I feel like it, or if I have a particularly boring weekend.
  With my posts you can expect a loosely structured, pseudo-scientific approach. The best thing is, as this isn't uni,
  technically I don't even have to cite sources, though I think i will here and there, just for good measure.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
